## Work Experience
**Graduate Teaching Assistant @ Northeastern University (_September 2023 - December 2023_)**

**Data Scientist @ Pontoon Solutions (_June 2023 - September 2023_ \| _July 2022 - December 2022_)**
<ol>
<li>**Recommendation Engine**
<ul>
  <li>Recognizing the need for a more robust and unbiased supplier selection process, I harnessed my expertise in Machine Learning and Power BI to transform the existing engine into a scalable, enterprise-level solution. This upgrade aggregates high-dimensional structured data and eliminates selection bias, significantly enhancing client-centricity in recruitment. My deep dive into the industry fueled this problem-solving approach and collaborative execution.</li>
  <li>Improved load time efficiency by 94% for over 1.5 million rows using a standardized data model with a Transform-Load pipeline linked to the data warehouse, leveraging Power Query and DAX queries.</li>
  <li>Maximized the recommendation similarity scores to 83% through EDA, statistical inference, and A/B experiments, resulting in reliable KPI features alongside tuned hyper-parameters for ensemble ML models like XGBoost and Random Forests.</li>
  <li>Maintained model version registry on Power BI workspace. Iteratively tested for model deviations and concept drift.</li>
  <li>Remodeled the application data model, curbing Python script runtime by 60% and boosting Power BI's data handling capacity 10x.</li>
</ul>
<li>**Spend Forecast**</li>
<ul>
  <li>Developed custom interactive R visual for multi-variate spend forecast using Node.js in the Power BI dashboard for enhanced financial decisions.</li>
  <li>Designed the User Interface following the HCI methods including paper modeling, user flow (Figma), A/B testing, and heuristic analysis.</li>
</ul>
<li>**Talent Demand Forecast**</li>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a tailored multi-variate predictive application on Power BI using R scripting for Talent Demand Forecast with extensive data preprocessing, statistical variable testing and elimination, and time-series model tuning.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

**Patent Data Analyst @ Researchwire Knowledge Solutions (_July 2019 - August 2021_)**
<ol>
  <li>Developed a prototype semantic text-matching model using TF-IDF and GloVe algorithms to identify infringing literature based on similarity with the source documents, improving the scraped dataset quality and reducing research hours by over 24 hours per project.</li>
  <li>Designed and implemented SQL-based Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipelines to efficiently process and maintain the integrity of literature data from web and patent mining tools, averaging 100k samples, in MySQL Workbench.</li>
  <li>Engineered UIPath automation tools and macro scripts for accelerated data cleaning and standardization tasks.</li>
  <li>Conducted a comprehensive market analysis, pinpointing strengths, resources, and under-leveraged opportunities. This intelligence, visualized through dynamic Tableau BI and spreadsheet dashboards, empowered stakeholders to make informed decisions. I further streamlined client interactions by modeling search strategies, workflows, and results in clear, compelling PPT reports, ultimately securing valuable inventions.</li>
  </li>
